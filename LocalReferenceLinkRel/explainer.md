## Introduction

Modern web development practices have converged towards building reusable
components instead of building monolithic documents. Frameworks such as React
and Angular have popularized this approach, which has made its way natively to
the web platform via Web Components.

Web Components allow for defining custom elements, and these custom elements
often rely on Shadow DOM for ID encapsulation. But Shadow DOM doesn't just
encapsulate ID's - it encapsulates style as well. The current preferred approach
for styling elements under a Shadow DOM is through `<link>` tags, but these tags
have several downsides, namely that they must be an external file or a dataURI.
The performance of an external file and developer ergonomics of generating a
dataURI make both of these options difficult to use. Because of that, developers
using Custom Elements have expressed strong interest in addressing these issues.

This explainer proposes a solution to this situation by allowing another option
for sharing styles via the `<link>` tag - local references to `<style>`
elements.

## Goals

- Allow developers to share styles defined in the Light DOM document into Shadow
  DOM trees.
- Allow developers to define their CSS up-front in the same document as their
  HTML when using Shadow DOM.
- Define a mechanism that will allow for more selective style sharing via CSS
  `@sheet`.
- Provide a foundation for allowing inline styles to be defined but not applied
  <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/AtSheet/explainer.md">via
  `@sheet`</a>.

## Non-goals

- Anything specific to `@sheet` should be discussed in its dedicated
  <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/AtSheet/explainer.md">proposal</a>.

## Proposal - Local References for Link Rel Tags

We propose supporting fragment identifiers that reference the `id` attribute of
a `<style>` or `<link>` tag:

```html
<style id="inline_styles">
  p {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<p>Outside Shadow DOM</p>
<template shadowrootmode="open">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="#inline_styles" />
  <p>Inside Shadow DOM</p>
</template>
```

With this functionality, the text "Inside Shadow DOM" will by styled blue, due
to the `<link rel="stylesheet" href="#inline_styles">` node's stylesheet
applying (along with the `color: blue` rule applying via the `p` selector in
that stylesheet).

### Scoping

```html
<template shadowrootmode="open">
  <style id="inline_styles_from_shadow">
    p {
      color: blue;
    }
  </style>
  <p>Inside Shadow DOM</p>
</template>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="#inline_styles_from_shadow" />
<p>
  Outside Shadow DOM. Styles defined inside the Shadow Root are not applied, so
  this text is not blue.
</p>
```

Due to existing Shadow DOM scoping behaviors, `<style>` tags defined inside the
Shadow DOM cannot be accessed from the Light DOM.

This means that `<style>` tags defined within a Shadow DOM are only accessible from
the shadow root where they are defined, as illustrated by the following examples:

```html
<template shadowrootmode="open">
  <style id="inline_styles_from_shadow">
    p {
      color: blue;
    }
  </style>
  <p>Inside Shadow DOM</p>
    <template shadowrootmode="open">
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="#inline_styles_from_shadow" />
      <p>Inside Nested Shadow DOM</p>
    </template>
</template>
```

<p>
  Styles defined inside the parent Shadow Root are not applied, so "Inside Nested Shadow DOM" is not blue.
</p>

```html
<template shadowrootmode="open">
  <style id="inline_styles_from_shadow">
    p {
      color: blue;
    }
  </style>
  <p>Inside Shadow DOM</p>
</template>
<template shadowrootmode="open">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="#inline_styles_from_shadow" />
  <p>Inside Sibling Shadow DOM</p>
</template>
```

<p>
  Styles defined inside the sibling Shadow Root are not applied, so "Inside Sibling Shadow DOM" is not blue.
</p>

In contrast to this proposal, [Declarative CSS Modules](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/ShadowDOM/explainer.md) always have global scope. Shadow DOM scoping could be modified though other means, as discussed
in [this thread](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11364). All of the suggestions in that thread would
allow for this feature to work with any shadow root, regardless of scope.

For example, the "Referencetarget inspired solution on `<template>`" would work with this feature as follows:

```html
<template exportids="foo"><!-- Exports 'foo' to the light DOM -->
  <template exportids="foo, bar">
    <style id="foo">
     ...
    </style>
    <style id="bar">
     ...
    </style>
  </template>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="#bar"> <!-- 'bar' is in scope due to `exportids` -->
</template>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="#foo"><!-- 'foo' is in the global scope, reference matched -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="#bar"><!-- 'bar' is not in scope, reference not matched -->
```

The other examples in https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11364 also use this proposal as an example
of how scoping can be expanded for Shadow DOM elements.

### Key Differences Between This Proposal And Declarative CSS Modules

Both this proposal and [Declarative CSS Modules](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/ShadowDOM/explainer.md)
allow authors to share inline CSS with Shadow Roots. There are some key differences in both syntax and
behaviors, as illustrated in the following table:

| | Local Reference Link Rel | Declarative CSS Modules | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Scope | ⚠️ [Standard DOM scoping](#Scoping) | Global scope |
| Identifier syntax | Standard HTML IDREF | Module identifier |
| Attribute used | Standard HTML `href` | New attribute for `identifier` |
| Uses existing HTML concepts | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Uses existing module concepts | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Extensibility | Clean @sheet integration, scope expansion could apply to SVG references | More declarative module types (HTML, SVG, etc.) |

### Extensibility

This proposal works nicely with CSS `@sheet`, allowing for the Light DOM to define styles that
only apply to selected Shadow DOM elements, as demonstrated by the following example:

```html
<style id="inline_styles">
@sheet my_sheet {
  p {
    color: blue;
  }
}
</style>
<p>"my_sheet" isn't imported into the light DOM, so this isn't blue</p>
<template shadowrootmode="open">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="#inline_styles" sheet="my_sheet" />
  <p>Inside Shadow DOM - "my_sheet" was included so this text is blue!</p>
</template>
```

All of proposals mentioned in https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11364 would not only benefit this
feature - SVG references, local anchors, and anything that takes an IDREF would benefit. For instance, SVG could benefit with this scoping extension as follows:

```html
<template exportids="foo"><!-- Exports 'foo' to the light DOM -->
  <template exportids="foo">
    <svg height="100" width="100">
      <circle id="foo" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="red" />
    </svg>
  </template>
  <svg height="100" width="100">
    <use href="#foo" /><!-- "foo" is in this shadow scope due to the "exportids" attribute above -->
  </svg>
</template>
<svg height="100" width="100">
  <use href="#foo" /><!-- "foo" is in the Light DOM scope due to the "exportids" attribute above -->
</svg>
```

### Fetch Behavior

In user agents where the Local References In `<link>` Tags feature is not
supported, the behavior for the `<link>` tag with the following markup in a
file named "foo.html" will be as follows:

```html
<style id="style_tag">
  p {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<template shadowrootmode="open">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="#style_tag" />
  <p>Inside Shadow DOM</p>
</template>
```

1. A fetch is initiated for `foo.html#style_tag` (a `<base>` tag may modify
the base URL).
2. Upon resolving the fetch (this will usually be a cache hit for the current
page), the `<link>` tag's `onerror` event is fired due to a MIME type mismatch
(the `<link>` tag expects a CSS MIME type when `rel="stylesheet"`, while
`foo.html#style_tag` is an HTML MIME type). Note that some
User Agents don't follow this behavior and instead fire `onload`.

There are several options to avoid this fetch:
1. Using a different value for `rel` than `stylesheet` (`inline-stylesheet`
is one option).
2. Using a different attribute than `href` for in-document stylesheets.
3. Using a special URL scheme, e.g. inline:id rather than relying on fragment
identifiers.

However, this may not be necessary. An easy method of polyfilling this behavior
is to simply add `onerror` and `onload` handlers that look up the `<style>`
element referenced and copy its contents into a dataURI, as follows:

```html
<style id="style_tag">
  p {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<script>
function polyfill(elem) {
  if(!elem.sheet || !elem.sheet.cssRules || elem.sheet.cssRules.length === 0) {
    // Extract the fragment from the link tag's `href` attribute.
    const url = new URL(elem.href);
    const fragment = url.hash.substring(1);
    if(fragment.length > 0) {
      // Look up the corresponding <style> tag with specified `href`.
      let style_tag = document.getElementById(fragment);
      if(style_tag && style_tag.sheet) {
        let css_rule_string = "";
        for(let i = 0; i < style_tag.sheet.rules.length; ++i) {
          css_rule_string += style_tag.sheet.rules[i].cssText + ";";
        }
        // Update the link tag with a dataURI with the referenced style rules.
        elem.setAttribute("href", "data:text/css;base64," + btoa(css_rule_string));
      }
    }
  }
}
</script>
<div>
  <template shadowrootmode="open">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="#style_tag" onerror="polyfill(this);" onload="polyfill(this);" />
    <p>Inside Shadow DOM</p>
  </template>
</div>
```

Note that this polyfill is not a live reference to the referenced stylesheet,
so changes to `style_tag` will not be reflected in the shadow DOM.

## Detailed design discussion

### Deep Clone vs Reference

`<link>` tags referencing external files are always treated as separate
instances, even when they refer to the same file. This also occurs with CSS
`@import` statements as defined in
https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-3/#import-processing.

However, in this situation, it might make more sense to behave like SVG `<use>`
(and other reference-based SVG elements) by behaving as if it's a reference to
the original stylesheet instead of a deep copy. This will allow for styles to
stay in sync when the stylesheet changes. This behavior could improve developer
ergonomics by keeping stylesheets in sync. This approach could also provide
memory savings due to the fact that there would only be one stylesheet in memory
instead of many copies.

#### Specific Changes to HTML and CSS

This proposal augments the HTML `<link>` tag by supporting fragment identifiers to
same-document `<style>` tags in the `href` attribute when the `rel` attribute is
`stylesheet`.

## Considered alternatives

1. [Declarative CSS Modules](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/ShadowDOM/explainer.md)
   are another mechanism for sharing styles between Declarative Shadow DOM and
   Light DOM without the use of JavaScript.
2. External CSS files in `<link>` tags - these are always asychronous (which may
   not be desired), and may have negative performance implications due to the
   need to fetch another resource.
3. CSS-encoded DataURI references in `<link>` tags - this approach avoids some
   of the issues with 2), but has poor developer ergonomics due to dataURI
   encoding. Furthermore, there is no ability to automatically synchronize
   dataURI values.

## Open Issues

1. "Deep Clone vs Reference" listed above is the biggest outstanding issue.

2. Should there be a way for Shadow DOM roots to export style ID's for sharing?
