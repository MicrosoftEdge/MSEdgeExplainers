# Microsoft Edge Explainers

Welcome! This repo is home to "explainers" and related documents originating 
from the Microsoft Edge team.

[Explainers](https://w3ctag.github.io/explainers) are documents focused on 
describing a user/ developer/ customer problem (at a high level) and exploring 
potential solutions. These documents are starting points for engaging in discussion 
with you and other members of the community. Explainers should address their 
stated problems in clear and easy to understand language. Proposed solutions
should be easy to follow and not too deep in technical details. When you read
an explainer, we hope the stated problem is compelling and you can form an 
opinion for whether the proposed solution would address the problem.

### Please provide feedback

We are looking for feedback! Are the stated problems actually real problems? 
How have they impacted your experience? Do the proposed solutions seem reasonable?
Do they follow good [web principles](https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/)?
Would they solve a problem you currently have? (We love to hear that; tell
us more about your scenario!) Do you have related use-cases we hadn't considered?

We appreciate you taking the time to offer feedback; it helps to improve the 
explainers, validate the problem and solutions they describe, and show evidence
that there is potential momentum to move an idea to the next stage--we desire
to see all our explainers make the journey to become cross-browser supported
web standards.

**[Start a new issue here](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/issues/new)**,
or [join in the discussion](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/issues/)
on existing issues. We also welcome PRs on the explainer documents themselves. 
Note: we use labels to filter the issues to specific explainers.

### Have a product bug?

If you're looking to file a product bug on Microsoft Edge and the bug is unique
to Edge, please use the in-browser "Send Feedback" tool (Alt+Shift+i in Windows,
or "..." > "Help and feedback"). If the bug reproduces in another Chromium-based
browser, please file the issue upstream in the [Chromium bug database](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/).
Thanks!

# Active Explainers ðŸ“£

These are the proposals we are currently investigating in this repo. Use the
links below to read the explainers, review the current issues, and file new
issues specifically for the given explainer(s). We hope they will all "graduate"
and begin their journey along the standards-track as they gain sufficient interest;
each explainer should have a "Status of this Document" section that indicates 
what standards venue they expect to go to next (if known). When they graduate,
we will move them into the [Alumni section](#alumni-).

# Withdrawn

When at first you don't succeed... don't give up! We're no longer pursuing
the solutions described in these explainers at this time, but that doesn't
mean the problem isn't worth solving. Have an idea for an alternate solution?
We'd love to hear your feedback!
