# Microsoft Edge Explainers

[Explainers](https://w3ctag.github.io/explainers) are documents where we focus on describing a user/ developer/ customer problem and explore potential solutions. These documents are starting points for engaging the community and standards bodies in developing collaborative solutions fit for eventual standardization.

This repo is intended to be a starting place for explainers originating from the Microsoft Edge team (and an archive of the same explainers if/when they migrate to longer-term homes in other repositories such as W3C Community Group/ Working Group or WHATWG workstream repositories).

We welcome public discussion in issues on these explainers. Thanks for your interest!
