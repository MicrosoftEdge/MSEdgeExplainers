## Introduction
Web component authors often want to create custom elements that have the activation behaviors from the native button element. Some of the key use cases are listed below:

- Custom buttons can be [popover invokers](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/popover.html#popoverinvokerelement) while providing unique styles and additional functionality (as discussed [here](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/1088)).

- Custom buttons can provide native [submit button](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#attr-button-type-submit) behavior so that the custom button can implicitly [submit forms](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#concept-form-submit) (as discussed [here](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/issues/814)). Similarly, custom buttons can also provide native [reset button](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#attr-button-type-reset) behavior that can [reset forms](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#concept-form-reset) .

Currently, web developers face challenges when trying to implement these behaviors in custom elements. The existing customized built-in approach using `extends` and `is` provides native button functionality but lacks full cross-browser support. As a result, developers are forced to manually reimplement button behaviors from scratch, leading to inconsistent implementations, accessibility issues, and development overhead.

This proposal addresses these challenges by introducing a standardized way for custom elements to opt into specific button activation behaviors through a simple static property declaration. By building on the established pattern of [form-associated custom elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/custom-elements.html#form-associated-custom-elements), this approach provides a familiar developer experience while ensuring cross-browser compatibility and proper integration with platform features like the [Invoker Commands API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Invoker_Commands_API).

### Goals
- A solution to support key button activation use cases, particularly command invocation.

### Non-goals
- Providing an alternative to the customized built-in solution (`extends` and `is`), i.e., enabling a custom element to do everything a native button does.
- A declarative version of this proposal. This requires finding a general solution for declarative custom elements, which should be explored separately.
- Providing guidance on how to indicate that new behavior has been added to an element, which is discussed [here](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/issues/1029).

## Proposal: add static `buttonActivationBehaviors` property
We propose enabling web component authors to create custom elements with button activation behaviors by adding a static `buttonActivationBehaviors` property to their custom element class definition.
This approach builds on the existing pattern established by form-associated custom elements ([FACEs](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/custom-elements.html#form-associated-custom-elements)) and accessibility semantics ([ARIAMixin](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#ARIAMixin)), where specific capabilities are exposed as discrete APIs that web developers can combine as needed.

```js
class CustomButton extends HTMLElement {
    static buttonActivationBehaviors = true;
}
customElements.define('custom-button', CustomButton);
```

**Supported attributes:**
When `static buttonActivationBehaviors = true` is set, the custom element would gain support for button activation-specific attributes:
- `commandfor` - Targets another element to be invoked
- `command` - Indicates to the targeted element which action to take

**Supported properties:**
The `ElementInternals` Interface would be extended with button activation-specific properties:
- `commandForElement` - Reflects the `commandfor` attribute
- `command` - Reflects the `command` attribute

If these properties are accessed on a custom element that does not have `static buttonActivationBehaviors = true`, a ["NotSupportedError"](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#notsupportederror) [DOMException](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#dfn-DOMException) should be thrown.

**Supported events:**
- `command` event - Fired on the element referenced by `commandfor` when the custom element is activated
- `click` event - Fired on the custom element

**IDL definitions:**
```webidl
partial interface ElementInternals {
  [CEReactions, Reflect] attribute Element? commandForElement;
  [CEReactions, ReflectSetter] attribute DOMString command;
};
```

**Implicit behaviors:**
Beyond attributes, properties, and events, custom elements with `buttonActivationBehaviors = true` also gain native behaviors related to button activation:
- **Click event activation**: The element fires click events when activated via mouse click, Enter key, Space key, or other activation methods
- **Focusable by default**: The element becomes focusable and participates in tab navigation without a developer-defined tabindex
- **Default ARIA semantics**: The element has a [button](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/button_role) default ARIA role. Note `ElementInternals.role` is not changed. This is following the pattern where `Element.role` does not reflect the `button` ARIA role of native `<button>`s

### Order of precedence regarding ARIA role
The order is `<custom-button role=foo>` > `ElementInternals.role` > default `button` role via `buttonActivationBehaviors`

## Examples
### Custom button with popover invocation
This example shows how to create a custom button that can invoke a popover element using the `commandfor` and `command` attributes:

```js
class CustomButton extends HTMLElement {
    static buttonActivationBehaviors = true;
}
customElements.define('custom-button', CustomButton);
```

```html
<custom-button commandfor="my-popover" command="toggle-popover">
    Toggle the popover
</custom-button>

<div id="my-popover" popover>
    <p>This popover is controlled by the custom button!</p>
</div>
```

### Custom button with imperative property configuration
This example shows how to configure the `commandForElement` and `command` properties imperatively:

```js
class CustomButton extends HTMLElement {
    static buttonActivationBehaviors = true;

    constructor() {
        super();
        this.internals_ = this.attachInternals();
    }

    get commandForElement() {
        return this.internals_.commandForElement ?? null;
    }

    set commandForElement(element) {
        this.internals_.commandForElement = element;
    }

    get command() {
        return this.internals_.command ?? '';
    }

    set command(value) {
        this.internals_.command = value;
    }
}
customElements.define('custom-button', CustomButton);
```

```html
<custom-button id="my-button">Open Dialog</custom-button>
<dialog id="my-dialog">Dialog content</dialog>

<script>
  const button = document.getElementById('my-button');
  const dialog = document.getElementById('my-dialog');

  button.commandForElement = dialog;
  button.command = 'show-modal';
</script>
```
## Comparison
The following examples demonstrate how much JS code can be saved with this proposal when a custom element author wants to support `command`/`commandfor` attributes:
### Without `buttonActivationBehaviors`
```js
class CustomButton extends HTMLElement {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.internals_ = this.attachInternals();
    }

    connectedCallback() {
        // ARIA role assignment
        this.internals_.role = 'button';

        // Make element focusable
        if (!this.hasAttribute('tabindex')) {
            this.tabIndex = 0;
        }

        this.addEventListener('click', this.handleClick);
    }

    handleClick() {
        const targetId = this.getAttribute('commandfor');
        const command = this.getAttribute('command');
        const target = document.getElementById(targetId);

        if (target) {
            if (command === "toggle-popover") {
                target.togglePopover();
            } else if (command === "show-popover") {
                target.showPopover();
            } else if (command === "hide-popover") {
                target.hidePopover();
            } else if (command === "show-modal") {
                target.showModal()
            } else if (command === "close") {
                target.close()
            } else if (command === "request-close") {
                target.requestClose()
            } 
                
            // Create and fire command event at the target element
            const commandEvent = new CustomEvent('command', {
                bubbles: true,
                cancelable: true
            });
            commandEvent.command = command;
            target.dispatchEvent(commandEvent);
        }
    }
}
customElements.define('custom-button', CustomButton);
```
### With `buttonActivationBehaviors`
```js
class CustomButton extends HTMLElement {
    static buttonActivationBehaviors = true;
}
customElements.define('custom-button', CustomButton);
```

## Future Work
### Add `buttonType` property on `ElementInternals`
To support _submit_ and _reset_ functionality, this proposal can be extended with a new `buttonType` property on `ElementInternals`, which defines how the custom element behaves when activated:

- `"button"` - (Default) No special form behavior, only fires click events and command invocation
- `"submit"` - Submits the associated form when activated
- `"reset"` - Resets the associated form when activated

If `buttonType` is set to any other value, it will fall back to the default value.

**IDL definitions:**
```webidl
partial interface ElementInternals {
  attribute DOMString buttonType;
};
```

#### `buttonType` and `formAssociated`
When `buttonActivationBehaviors` is set to true, the custom element's form association behavior depends on the `buttonType` value:

- **`buttonType = "submit"` or `"reset"`**: The element automatically becomes form-associated and `static formAssociated = true/false;` becomes a no-op.
- **`buttonType = "button"`**: The element does not become form-associated automatically. If form association is needed, `static formAssociated = true` must be explicitly set.

This mirrors the behavior of native `<button>` elements, where only submit and reset buttons participate in form submission and validation.

**Rationale for the `buttonType` property:**
The `buttonType` property is essential because it allows custom element authors to create a single custom button class that can handle all three native button behaviors without requiring separate class definitions. Without this property, new static properties (e.g. `enableSubmitBehavior = true`) would be needed to support the submit and reset behaviors, and developers would need to create three different custom element classes, e.g., `custom-submit-button`, `custom-reset-button`, `custom-regular-button`, just to support the different type values from the native button element. This approach provides the same flexibility as the native `<button>` element's `type` attribute, wihch let custom element users configure the behaviors declaratively through the custom element's attributes.

**Supported attributes when `buttonType="submit"`:**
- `formaction` - URL to use for form submission
- `formenctype` - Entry list encoding type to use for form submission
- `formmethod` - Variant to use for form submission
- `formnovalidate` - Bypass form control validation for form submission
- `formtarget` - Navigable for form submission

**Supported properties when `buttonType="submit"`:**
The `ElementInternals` interface would be extended with these properties which are applicable only when `buttonType="submit"`:
- `formAction` - reflects the `formaction` attribute
- `formEnctype` - reflects the `formenctype` attribute
- `formMethod` - reflects the `formmethod` attribute
- `formNoValidate` - reflects the `formnovalidate` attribute
- `formTarget` - reflects the `formtarget` attribute

If any of these properties are accessed on a custom element that does not have both `static buttonActivationBehaviors = true` and `buttonType = "submit"`, a ["NotSupportedError"](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#notsupportederror) [DOMException](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#dfn-DOMException) should be thrown.

**Implicit behaviors:**
- **Form submission**: When associated with a `<form>`, pressing Enter on an associated form control (e.g., a text input) will trigger submit behavior if the custom element `buttonType` is `"submit"`.

#### Example

```js
class CustomButton extends HTMLElement {
    static buttonActivationBehaviors = true;
    static observedAttributes = ['type'];

    constructor() {
        super();
        this.internals_ = this.attachInternals();
    }

    attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) {
        if (name === 'type') {
            this.internals_.buttonType = newValue;
        }
    }
}
customElements.define('custom-button', CustomButton);
```

```html
<form>
    <!-- Submit button -->
    <custom-button type="submit">Submit Form</custom-button>

    <!-- Reset button -->
    <custom-button type="reset">Reset Form</custom-button>

    <!-- Regular button -->
    <custom-button type="button" commandfor="my-dialog" command="showModal">
        Open Dialog
    </custom-button>
</form>
```
### Open questions
If additional behaviors are introduced in the future, how should potential conflicts be addressed? For example:

- **Conflicting semantics**: How should we handle ambiguity when combining command invocation behavior with label behavior? Should the element have an ARIA role of `button`, or none at all since labels lack an implicit ARIA role?
- **Interaction conflicts**: When clicked, the [Invoker Commands API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Invoker_Commands_API) will automatically trigger command invocation, but should the element also transfer focus to a labeled control (label behavior)? Would this dual behavior create confusion or negatively impact the user experience?
- **Specification complexity**: How can we define conflict resolution for these combinations without introducing excessive edge cases and complexity?

```js
class CustomElement extends HTMLElement {
    static buttonActivationBehaviors = true;
    static labelBehaviors = true;

    constructor() {
        super();
        this.internals_ = this.attachInternals();
    }

    get commandForElement() {
        return this.internals_.commandForElement ?? null;
    }

    set commandForElement(element) {
        this.internals_.commandForElement = element;
    }

    get control() {
        return this.internals_.control ?? null;
    }

    set htmlFor(value) {
        this.internals_.htmlFor = value;
    }

    // Manual handling of label behavior (command invocation is handled automatically)
    handleLabelClick(event) {
        // Should this also transfer focus to labeled control (label behavior)?
        // Developers must resolve this conflict manually since command invocation
        // is automatically handled by the Invoker Commands API
        if (this.control) {
            // Label behavior: focus the labeled control
            this.control.focus();
        }
    }

    connectedCallback() {
        // Manual role conflict resolution - developers must decide
        // whether this should be a button or label
        this.internals_.role = 'button'; // or no role for label behavior?

        // Manual focus management for button behavior
        if (!this.hasAttribute('tabindex')) {
            this.tabIndex = 0;
        }

        // Manual event handling for label behavior (command invocation is automatic)
        this.addEventListener('click', this.handleLabelClick.bind(this));
    }
}
customElements.define('custom-element', CustomButton);
```
## Alternatives considered

### 1. ElementInternals feature decomposition approach
This alternative approach focuses on decomposing native element behaviors into granular functionalities exposed through `ElementInternals`. This approach also builds on the existing pattern established by form-associated custom elements ([FACEs](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/custom-elements.html#form-associated-custom-elements)) and accessibility semantics ([ARIAMixin](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#ARIAMixin)), where specific capabilities are exposed as discrete APIs that web developers can combine as needed.

```js
class CustomButton extends HTMLElement {
    static canUseCommandInvocation = true;
}
customElements.define('custom-button', CustomButton);
```

**Key difference from the main proposal**: Unlike the main proposal which includes implicit (default) behaviors when `buttonActivationBehaviors = true`, this decomposition approach provides only the minimal command invocation functionality. The [Invoker Commands API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Invoker_Commands_API) provides a way to declaratively assign behaviors to buttons, allowing control of interactive elements when the button is activated (clicked or invoked via keypress), but web developers must manually handle accessibility features like ARIA roles and focus management.

Key characteristics of this approach include:
- **Explicit opt-in**: Each behavior is enabled via static properties and `ElementInternals` properties.
- **Composable design**: Multiple behaviors can be combined on a single element.
- **Clear semantics**: Each API explicitly defines the algorithms and behaviors it affects.
- **Manual accessibility implementation**: Unlike the main proposal, developers must manually implement accessibility semantics and focusability behaviors to deliver a complete user experience. For instance, a custom element with only `commandForElement` functionality would need additional manual implementation for:
  - **Accessibility**: ARIA role assignment (`button`).
  - **Focusability**: Making the element focusable and ensuring proper tab navigation.

```js
class CustomButton extends HTMLElement {
    static canUseCommandInvocation = true;

    constructor() {
        super();
        this.internals_ = this.attachInternals();
    }

    get commandForElement() {
        return this.internals_.commandForElement ?? null;
    }

    set commandForElement(element) {
        this.internals_.commandForElement = element;
    }

    get command() {
        return this.internals_.command ?? '';
    }

    set command(value) {
        this.internals_.command = value;
    }

    connectedCallback() {
        // In the decomposition approach, developers must manually handle:
        // 1. ARIA role assignment
        this.internals_.role = 'button';

        // 2. Focus management - make element focusable
        if (!this.hasAttribute('tabindex')) {
            this.tabIndex = 0;
        }
    }
}
customElements.define('custom-button', CustomButton);
```

**IDL definitions:**
```webidl
partial interface ElementInternals {
  [CEReactions, Reflect] attribute Element? commandForElement;
  [CEReactions, ReflectSetter] attribute DOMString command;
};
```

**Supported attributes:**
When `static canUseCommandInvocation = true` is set, the custom element would gain support for button activation-specific attributes:
- `commandfor` - Targets another element to be invoked
- `command` - Indicates to the targeted element which action to take

**Supported properties:**
The `ElementInternals` Interface would be extended with minimal command invocation properties:
- `commandForElement` - Reflects the `commandfor` attribute
- `command` - Reflects the `command` attribute

**Supported events:**
- `command` event - Fired on the element referenced by `commandfor` when the custom element is activated
- `click` event - Fired on the custom element

**Trade-offs of this approach**
- **Accessibility risks**: Without automatic defaults, developers may forget to implement critical accessibility features, leading to inaccessible custom elements.

We consulted the [ARIA Working Group](https://github.com/w3c/aria/issues/2637) on this approach versus the main proposal with built-in defaults (implicit behaviors), and the [overwhelming consensus](https://www.w3.org/2025/09/25-aria-minutes.html#d0af) was to provide accessibility defaults that can be potentially overwritten by "power users" through `elementInternals.role`.

### 2. Static `behavesLike` property with behavior-specific interface mixins
This alternative approach enables web component authors to create custom elements with native behaviors by adding a static `behavesLike` property to their custom element class definition. This property can be set to string values that represent native element types:

```js
class CustomButton extends HTMLElement {
    static behavesLike = 'button';
}
customElements.define('custom-button', CustomButton);
```

Additionally, this approach includes behavior-specific interface mixins that expose the full set of properties available to each element type. These mixins are available through `buttonMixin` and `labelMixin` properties on `ElementInternals`.

The initial set of `behavesLike` values being proposed are listed below. Support for additional values may be added in the future.
- `'button'` - for [button](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#the-button-element) like behavior
- `'label'` - for [label](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#the-label-element) like behavior

If `behavesLike` is assigned any other value, a ["NotSupportedError"](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#notsupportederror) [DOMException](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#dfn-DOMException) should be thrown during `customElements.define()`.

`behavesLike` is a static property that must be set in the class definition and cannot be changed after the custom element is defined. This works similarly to the static [`formAssociated`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements-face-example) property that determines form association capabilities.

#### `static behavesLike = 'button'` and `elementInternals.buttonMixin`
When `static behavesLike = 'button'` is set in a custom element's class definition, the custom element will gain support for all button-specific attributes, properties, and methods.

**Supported attributes:**
- `disabled` - Whether the form control is disabled
- `form` - Associates the element with a form element
- `formaction` - URL to use for form submission
- `formenctype` - Entry list encoding type to use for form submission
- `formmethod` - Variant to use for form submission
- `formnovalidate` - Bypass form control validation for form submission
- `formtarget` - Navigable for form submission
- `name` - Name of the element to use for form submission
- `type` - Type of button (submit/reset/button)
- `value` - Value to be used for form submission
- `popovertarget` - Targets a popover element to toggle, show, or hide
- `popovertargetaction` - Indicates whether a targeted popover element is to be toggled, shown, or hidden
- `command` - Indicates to the targeted element which action to take
- `commandfor` - Targets another element to be invoked
- `interestfor` - [Shipping in Chromium](https://chromestatus.com/feature/4530756656562176?gate=4768466822496256)

**Supported properties:**
The `elementInternals.buttonMixin` property provides access to button-specific properties:
- `disabled` - reflects the `disabled` attribute
- `form` - returns the associated HTMLFormElement
- `formAction` - reflects the `formaction` attribute
- `formEnctype` - reflects the `formenctype` attribute
- `formMethod` - reflects the `formmethod` attribute
- `formNoValidate` - reflects the `formnovalidate` attribute
- `formTarget` - reflects the `formtarget` attribute
- `labels` - returns a NodeList of associated label elements
- `name` - reflects the `name` attribute
- `type` - reflects the `type` attribute
- `value` - reflects the `value` attribute
- `willValidate` - indicates whether the element is a candidate for constraint validation
- `validity` - returns the ValidityState representing validation states
- `validationMessage` - returns localized validation message
- `command` - returns the value of the `command` attribute
- `commandForElement` - returns the Element referenced by the `commandfor` attribute
- `popoverTargetAction` - returns the value of the `popovertargetaction` attribute
- `popoverTargetElement` - returns the Element referenced by the `popovertarget` attribute

**Supported methods:**
The `elementInternals.buttonMixin` property also provides access to button-specific methods:
- `checkValidity()` - returns true if the element's value has no validity problems; If false, the method also fires an invalid event on the custom element.
- `reportValidity()` - performs the same validity checking steps as the checkValidity() method, and if the invalid event isn't canceled, reports the problem to the user
- `setCustomValidity(message)` - sets a custom error message that is displayed when the form is submitted

#### Example

```js
class CustomButton extends HTMLElement {
    static behavesLike = 'button';
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.internals_ = this.attachInternals();
    }

    get popoverTargetElement() {
        return this.internals_.buttonMixin?.popoverTargetElement ?? null;
    }

    set popoverTargetElement(element) {
        if (this.internals_.buttonMixin) {
            this.internals_.buttonMixin.popoverTargetElement = element;
        }
    }
}
customElements.define('custom-button', CustomButton);
```

```html
<custom-button popovertarget="my-popover">Open popover</custom-button>
<div id="my-popover" popover>This is popover content.</div>
```

**Implicit button behavior:**
Beyond attributes and properties, custom elements with `behavesLike = 'button'` also gain native button behaviors:
- **Default submit behavior**: The default `type` is "submit", the button will submit its associated form when activated
- **Implicit form submission**: When associated with a `<form>`, pressing Enter on an associated form control (e.g., a text input) will trigger the custom element's submit behavior if the button's `type` is "submit"
- **Form association**: The custom element automatically becomes form-associated and participates in form submission and validation
- **Click event activation**: Fire click events when activated via mouse click, Enter key, Space key, or other activation methods
- **Focusable by default**: The element becomes focusable and participates in tab navigation without requiring `tabindex`
- **Default ARIA semantics**: Have a [button](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/button_role) default ARIA role

#### `static behavesLike = 'label'` and `elementInternals.labelMixin`
When `static behavesLike = 'label'` is set in a custom element's class definition, the custom element will gain support for all label-specific attributes and properties.

**Supported attributes:**
- `for` - Associates the label with a form control via the referenced element's ID

**Supported properties:**
The `elementInternals.labelMixin` property provides access to a `LabelInternals` interface that exposes label-specific properties:
- `htmlFor` - reflects the `for` attribute
- `control` - returns the Element referenced by the `for` attribute (the labeled control)
- `form` - returns the HTMLFormElement that the labeled control is associated with, or null if none

#### Example

```js
class CustomLabel extends HTMLElement {
    static behavesLike = 'label';
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.internals_ = this.attachInternals();
    }

    get control() {
        return this.internals.labelMixin?.control ?? null;
    }
}
customElements.define('custom-label', CustomLabel);
```

```html
<custom-label for='my-checkbox'>Toggle checkbox</custom-label>
<input type='checkbox' id='my-checkbox' />
```

**Implicit label behavior:**
Beyond attributes and properties, custom elements with `behavesLike = 'label'` also gain native label behaviors:
- **Implicit association**: If no `for` attribute is specified, the first labelable element descendant automatically becomes the labeled control
- **Click delegation**: Clicking the custom label will activate its associated control (focus text inputs, toggle checkboxes, etc.)
- **Accessibility integration**: The label becomes the associated element's accessible name for screen readers and other assistive technologies

#### Behavior-specific interfaces
This approach includes behavior-specific interfaces (`buttonMixin`, `labelMixin`) that provide access to DOM properties corresponding to element-specific attributes.

**Interface availability:**
- `elementInternals.buttonMixin` returns a `ButtonInternals` interface when `behavesLike` is `'button'`, otherwise `null`
- `elementInternals.labelMixin` returns a `LabelInternals` interface when `behavesLike` is `'label'`, otherwise `null`

**IDL definitions:**
```webidl
partial interface ElementInternals {
  readonly attribute ButtonInternals? buttonMixin;
  readonly attribute LabelInternals? labelMixin;
};

interface ButtonInternals {
  attribute Element? popoverTargetElement;
  attribute Element? commandForElement;
  attribute DOMString popoverTargetAction;
  // ... additional properties skipped for brevity
};

interface LabelInternals {
  attribute DOMString htmlFor;
  readonly attribute Element? control;
  // ... additional properties skipped for brevity
};
```

#### Order of precedence for used values: Element content attributes > `ElementInternals` properties > default properties via `behavesLike`
When `behavesLike` is set, the custom element will be assigned the same defaults as the corresponding native element. For example, if `behavesLike = 'button'` is set, the custom element's default ARIA role will become `button` and this will be the used role if no explicit role is specified by the author. If the author sets `elementInternals.role`, the value of `elementInternals.role` will be the used role, taking precedence over the default role. If the author sets the `role` attribute on the custom element, the value of the `role` attribute will be the used role, taking precedence over both `elementInternals.role` and the default role.

#### `behavesLike` with `extends`/`is` customized built-ins
If a custom element is defined with both `static behavesLike` and `extends`/`is`, a ["NotSupportedError"](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#notsupportederror) [DOMException](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#dfn-DOMException) should be thrown during `customElements.define()`.

This is because `behavesLike` functionality depends on `ElementInternals` (for its interface mixins, e.g., `elementInternals.buttonMixin`, `elementInternals.labelMixin`) which won't be available if the element is defined with `extends`/`is` (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#dom-attachinternals)

#### `behavesLike` does not change element appearance
Setting `behavesLike` gives a custom element native element like behavior, but the custom element's appearance does not change. In other words, the custom element does not take on default, author-specified or user-specified styles that target the native element, since the custom element has a different tag name (e.g., `<fancy-button>` instead of `<button>`).

#### `behavesLike` and `formAssociated`
If the element type specified by `behavesLike` is already a [form-associated element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#form-associated-element) (such as `'button'`), then `static formAssociated = true/false;` becomes a no-op since the element will automatically gain form association capabilities from its specified behavior.

**Benefits of this approach**
- **Complete API surface**: Provides both attribute and property access, matching native elements
- **Discoverability**: Grouped interfaces make it clear which properties are available for each behavior
- **No naming conflicts**: Avoids conflicts when different element types have properties with the same name.

### 3. `elementInternals.type` property approach
This alternative approach introduces a `type` property on `ElementInternals` that could be set at runtime in the constructor.

Key characteristics of this approach include:
- `elementInternals.type` could be set to values like `'button'`, `'submit'`, `'reset'`, `'label'`
- The property could only be set once and would throw an exception if set again
- Setting occurred in the constructor after calling `attachInternals()`

```js
class CustomButton extends HTMLElement {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.internals_ = this.attachInternals();
        this.internals_.type = 'button';
    }
}
```

**Trade-offs of this approach**
- **Semantic inconsistency: Mixed abstraction levels**. Values like `'button'`, `'submit'`, `'reset'`, `'label'` mixed element types (button, label) with button subtypes (submit, reset), creating unclear semantics about what the property actually represented
- **Timing concern: When to set**. Unclear whether the property should be set in the constructor, `connectedCallback()`, or elsewhere
- **Mutability concern: Immutability enforcement**. Additional logic needed to prevent the property from being changed after initial setting

### 4. `extends` and `is` attribute approach
A partial solution for the key use cases described above already exists today. Authors can specify the `extends` option when [defining a custom element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#dom-customelementregistry-define). Authors can then use the `is` attribute to give a built-in element a custom name, thereby turning it into a customized built-in element.

Both `extends` and `is` are supported in Firefox and Chromium-based browsers. However, this solution has limitations, such as not being able to attach shadow trees to (most) customized built-in elements. Citing these limitations, Safari doesn't plan to support customized built-ins in this way and have shared their objections here: https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/97#issuecomment-1328880274. As such, `extends` and `is` are not on a path to full interoperability today.
