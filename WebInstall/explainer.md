# **Web Install API**

Authors: [Diego Gonzalez](https://github.com/diekus)

Work on the Web Install API has been split into **[same-domain](./explainer_same_domain.md)** installs and **[cross-domain](./explainer_cross_domain.md)** installs. This is to ensure better alignment with different use cases and to proceed with the work on the API in a phased approach, as recommended by the early [W3C TAG review](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/888#issuecomment-1734131209).
