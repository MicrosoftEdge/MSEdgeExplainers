##  Introduction

Current paradigms of application discovery involve a user going to an application repository to search and install apps. These repositories are generally curated and have a level of trust associated by the user. They play a vital role in allowing a user to acquire high quality apps. Application repositories are valuable because they help developers acquire users, which incentivises developers to create better apps on the web platorm.

While this is the general acquisition flow on many platforms, the web does not have the ability to replicate this scenario because it can not install applications. This makes it impossible for a web app (repository, catalog, store) to install and distribute other applications.

**The Web Install API** addresses this shortcoming in the platform. It **allows a web site to install a web app. This functionality allows the creation of web based catalogs that can install PWAs directly from the web and into multiple platforms.**

## Goals

* **Enable installation of web apps (cross-domain).**
* Enable UAs to supress potential installation-prompt spam. 

## Non-goals
* Replace `beforeinstallprompt` or associated behaviour (this is the way to install from the same-domain).
* Change the way the UA currently prompts for installation of a PWA.
* Associate ratings and reviews with the installed app ([see Ratings and Reviews API explainer](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/RatingsAndReviewsPrompt/explainer.md)).
* Process payments for installation of PWAs ([see Payment Request API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API)).
* List purchased/installed goods from a store ([see Digital Goods API](https://github.com/WICG/digital-goods/blob/main/explainer.md)).
* Installing non-PWAs or apps that do not pass the installability criteria (for security reasons).
* Enumerate if the app/related apps are installed ([see getInstalledRelatedApps](https://github.com/WICG/get-installed-related-apps/blob/main/EXPLAINER.md)).

## Use Cases
There are several use cases that the Web Install API enables:

* **Web app installation from associated domain:** An associated domain (out-of-scope of the PWA) could prompt for the installation of the web app (in a different domain).

```javascript
/* example of using navigator.install, permissions API and onbeforeinstallprompt */

if('install' in navigator) {
    //tries to install the PWA that is not in the same scope
    navigator.install('https://app.contoso.com')
    .then( origin => {
        // installation was initiated (prompted) by the UA
        console.log(`Installation started from ${origin}.`)
    })
    .catch(reason => {
        //if the website has no permission to install
        if (reason === "disallowed") {
            const { state } = await navigator.permissions.query({
              name: "installation"
            });
            //check if permission has been asked
            switch (state) {
                case "prompt":
                    //shows the install button in the web
                    //this will call the prompt() method of the onbeforeinstallprompt
                    showInstallButton();
                break;
            }
	}
    });
}
```
Manifest file for the Contoso App, allowing installation *ONLY* from contoso.com :
```json
{
    "name": "Contoso App",
    "display": "standalone",
    "start_url": "/index.html",
    "install_sources": [ 
	    {"origin": "contoso.com"}   
    ]
}
```

![Different domain install flow](./difdomaininstall.png) 

* **Creation of online catalogs:** A web app can list and install web apps. For example, `apprepo.com` would be able to distribute apps on multiple platforms and multiple devices.

```javascript
/* tries to install a cross-domain web app */

if('install' in navigator) {
    //tries to install a cross-domain web app
    navigator.install('https://www.website.com')
    .then( origin => {
        // installation was initiated (prompted) by the UA
        console.log(`Installation started from ${origin}.`)
    })
    .catch(reason => {
        if(reason === "not-installable") {
            // target site is not installable
            console.log("Website is not an installable app.");
	}
        else if (reason === "disallowed") {
            // origin cannot install other webapps.
            console.log("Origin does not have permissions to install web apps.");
	}
    });
}
```

Additionally for developers, the feature also:
* provides a more fine-grained control of when/where to let an installation of a web app occur.
* allows cross-domain installation of PWAs.
* allows for better testing/debugging in comparison to installation prompts based on heuristics. 

## Proposed Solution

### The `navigator.install` method
To install a PWA, a PWA would use the promise-based method `navigator.install(<url>[, <params>]);`. This method will:
* Resolve when an installation prompt has been shown.
    * The success value will be equal to the origin that initiated the install.

```javascript
/* example of using navigator.install */

if ('install' in navigator ) {
    navigator.install('https://www.elk.zone')
    .then( origin => console.log( `Installation started from ${origin}` ));
}
```

* Be rejected if the prompt is not shown and have a `reason` value of:
    * "disallowed": `String` indicating the origin website trying to install the web app does not have install permissions.
    * "not-installable": `String` indicating that the target website is not installable.
    * *error*: instance of `Error` providing details about an error that happened.
 
```javascript
(...)
.catch(reason => {
    if(reason === "not-installable") {
        // target site is not installable
        console.log("Website is not an installable app.");
    }
    else if (reason === "disallowed") {
        // origin cannot install other webapps.
        console.log("Origin does not have permissions to install web apps.");
    }
    else {
        console.log(reason);
    }
});
```

Resolution of the promise does not indicate that the app was installed. It only indicates that the installation prompt has been shown. This is a design decision to preserve privacy.

#### Signatures of the `install` method
The Web Install API consists of the extension to the navigator interface with the install method. The install method can be used in 3 different ways. There is no difference in behaviour when this is called from a standalone window or a tab.

1. `navigator.install(<url>)`: The method receives a parameter which is a url to a web app to install. This can be a cross-domain app and will prompt for installation of the app if the requesting origin has installation permissions (see security section). This is the most common use of the API.

2. `navigator.install(<url [, <params]>)`: This signature of the method includes the optional parameters. These parameters alter how the app is installed and are defined in an object. More information about the parameters is found in the Params subsection of this specification.

#### Parameters

The `navigator.install` call can receive an object with a set of parameters that specify different installation behaviours for the app.

* **mode**: Due to the evolving nature of PWAs, there are different surfaces where these can be installed. The optional parameters that can be passed on to the `navigator.install` call can hint to the UA if the app should be installed as a standalone app or as a sidebar bar if supported. `mode` is an array of values that hint to the preferred way of installing the app. Among the values it can have are `default` and `sidebar`. These values will always fallback to a standalone installation.  

As an example, you could try to install the elk PWA in a browser that supports a sidebar with this code:

```javascript
navigator.install('https://elk.zone', {mode: ['sidebar']});
```

#### Installing the web app

To install the web app, the process is as follows:
1. Origin site that triggers the installation must have installation permissions if it tries to install a cross-domain app.
2. Check if the domain is in the list of allowed origins to install said PWA by checking the manifest file (see security section below for more details).
3. Prompt the user for install confirmation.
4. Install the app.
5. UA default action post-install (generally the app will open). 
   
### The `navigator.canInstall` method

The `navigator.canInstall()` is an aysnc method that returns `true` if the equivalent call to `navigator.install()` would succeed. The method returns `false` if the install cannot be *validated*. Reasons for this include:
* The target url is not an installable app.
* The target url is  badly formatted.
* The target url resolves to a client/server error response.

```javascript
/* example of using the canInstall method */

if('canInstall' in navigator) {
    if(navigator.canInstall("https://elk.zone")) {
        showAppInstallButton();
    }
    else {
        redirectToPlatformStorePage();
    }
}
```

#### Warning: Throttling of the `canInstall()` method
The `canInstall` method should only be used in situations where an assessment of the installation needs to be performed. The method is expensive and UAs should throttle it by executing calls to this method sequentially rather than parallel for example.

*UAs may take actions to discourage or prohibit some calls to this method.*

## Relation with other web APIs 

* **`navigator.install` and Permissions API:** see [integrations with the Permissions API](https://github.com/edge-microsoft/MSEdgeExplainers-private/edit/luigonza/web-install/WebInstall/explainer.md#integration-with-the-permissions-api).

* **`navigator.install` and manifest file's `prefer_related_applications`:** When the `related_applications` and `prefer_related_applications` key/values are present in the manifest, the UA should try to handoff the install to the prefered catalog. If this is not possible then it fallback to a default UA install.
  
## Privacy and Security Considerations

### Avoiding Installation prompt spamming
* The biggest risk for the API is installation spamming. To minimize this behaviour, installing a PWA using the Web Install API requires a [user gesture](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#activation-triggering-input-event).  

* A new permission type will be introduced for an origin, that would allow it to install web apps. The first time a website requests to install an app (use the API) the UA will prompt the user to confirm that the website can install other apps into the device. This prompt is similar to that of other permissions like geolocation or camera/microphone. The UA can decide how to implement this prompt.

A website that wants to install apps will require this new permission and will only be able to prompt the user for this in a period of time defined by the implementer. This will avoid spam from websites constantly asking for a permission to install apps, and will force websites to only prompt when there is a meaningful user intent to install apps.

The installation permission for an origin should be time-limited and expire after a period of time defined by the UA. After the permission expires the UA will prompt again for permission from the user.

####  Integration with the Permissions API
A new permission that can be associated with an origin means a new integration with the [Permissions API](https://www.w3.org/TR/permissions/). The install API will make available the "installation" [PermissionDescriptor](https://www.w3.org/TR/permissions/#dom-permissiondescriptor) as a new [*powerful feature*](https://www.w3.org/TR/permissions/#dfn-specifies-a-powerful-feature). This would make it possible to know programmatically if `install` would be blocked.

```javascript
/* example of querying for the state of an installation permission using the Permission API  */

const { state } = await navigator.permissions.query({
  name: "installation"
});
switch (state) {
  case "granted":
    navigator.install('https://elk.zone');
    break;
  case "prompt":
    //shows the install button in the web UI
    showInstallButton();
    break;
  case "denied":
    redirectToAppStore();
    break;
}
```

* A new field called `install_sources` will be added to the manifest file to have a control list of sites that can install the app. In its most restrictive case, the developer can specify to not allow installation from any other origin, in which case the PWA conforms to its usual behaviour of only being able to be installed from its same origin.

```json

{
    "name": "Awesome PWA",
    "display": "standalone",
    "start_url": "/index.html",
    "install_sources": [ 
	    {"origin": "apps.microsoft.com"},
	    {"origin": "store.app"}     
    ]
}
```

This will protect the app from being listed in undesirable repositories and give the developer absolute control about where do they want the PWA to be installed from. At best, the developer can allow the PWA to be installed from any site ("`*`"), at its most restrictive, it can only allow installing from the app's same scope. This field is only for the JS API and does not interfere with existing ways of installing PWAs through mechanisms like enterprise policies.

If no `install_sources` is present in the manifest file, the default should be to not allow an app to be installed from cross-domain sites. An open question is to reverse this default during dev/origin trial to experiment what is the best course of action while the feature gets traction among developers.  

**The user gesture, the new origin permission, the new manifest field and the final installation confirmation (current default behaviour in the browser before installing an app) work together to minimize the risk of origins spamming the user for unrequested installations**, give developers complete flexibility about where their apps will be installed from and provide the user with an implicit (double: one for the user gesture, the other one from the prompt before installing) confirmation before the app gets installed on their device.

## Alternative Solutions

* **HTML anchor tag target install
`<a href="https://airhorner.com" target="_install">honk</a>`:** An alternate solution to allow installation of web apps is by allowing a new target type of `_install` to the HTML anchor tag. This has the benefit of being able to work in environments that have JS disabled and can also be another entry point for installation. While this is an elegant solution, it limits the amount of information a developer can act upon that the promise does provide, such as if the prompt was shown or if the origin has permissions to install apps.

* **Having `navigator.install()` prompt for a same-domain installation:** Most modern browsers that already implement the `onbeforeinstallprompt` event will prompt once it is detected that the application can be installed and generally on page load. *The same domain install process has been already solved by `onbeforeinstallprompt`*.

## Open Questions

* Should we enable a [try-before-you-buy](https://github.com/PEConn/web-install-explainer/blob/main/explainer.md#try-before-you-buy) flow scenario for web install?

* Should we provide feedback to the directory?

* Do we need to attribute the source of the installation?
On a successful promise resolution, the origin is returned so the originating web app can decide to use that information as it pleases.

* Should we allow an [`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) to enable cancelling the installation if the process takes too long?

* Should the default for a PWA without `install_sources` in its manifest file be installable from anywhere or not installable from cross-domain sites? A transition period and experimentation is encouraged during dev/origin trial to establish the best solution for developers.
