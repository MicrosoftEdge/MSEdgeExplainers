## Introduction

A number of operating systems offer a means by which authors add menu items to the app launcher icon itself. These provide quick access to key tasks for an app. Typically, these are exposed via a right click, long tap, or a similar context menu-triggering action. The list of shortcut actions often contains a mixture of static and dynamic shortcuts.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> Generally these number around 4–5, depending on the platform—or in the case of Android, the launcher—used. Adding these to the web platform provides an equivalent capability to native apps on many platforms.

## Why are Shortcuts needed?

Shortcuts will provide another mechanism for websites (especially progressive web apps) to facilitate re-engagement with key tasks.

## Goals for v1

* Enable authors to provide a list of shortcuts to specific URLs within their website in a standardized fashion
* Enable users to access key tasks easily

## Non-goals for v1

* Enable authors to access or mutate Shortcuts via JavaScript
* Enable authors to directly trigger JavaScript events from Shortcuts

## Use Cases

Most websites (and, by extension, progressive web apps) have a handful of key tasks that users need to do with relative frequency. Providing quick access to those tasks from anywhere the app icon is displayed will improve users’ productivity as well as increase their engagement with the app. It will also reduce the number of clicks needed to access numerous locations and features including, but not limited to:

* Top-level navigation items (e.g., home, timeline, orders),
* Search,
* Data entry tasks (e.g., compose an email or tweet, add a receipt), and
* Activities (e.g., start a chat with the 4 most popular contacts in your contacts).

### Examples

#### PlayerFM "Shortcuts" in Android

<figure id="playerfm">

![](1.png)

</figure>

This menu provides access to the following app functionality:

* Play Later - a list of podcasts the user flagged for later listening;
* Subscriptions - the user’s entire subscription catalog;
* Search; and
* Discover - browse available & promoted podcasts.

#### Slack’s "Dock Menu" in macOS

<figure id="slack">

![](2.png)

</figure>

This menu provides a list of Slack “workspaces” the user is signed into, followed by a link to “Sign into another workspace.”

#### Twitter’s "Jump List" in Windows 10

<figure id="twitter">

![](3.png)

</figure>

This menu provides direct access to:

* Compose a new tweet;
* Search (a.k.a. Explore);
* Access the user’s notifications; and
* Access the user’s direct messages

### Customer validation

* **Twitter** is actively using [Windows’ "Jump Lists" feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.UI.StartScreen.JumpList) in their PWA via WinRT (see [the above example](#twitter)).
* **Starbucks** has also expressed interest in increasing re-engagement with their PWA by providing quick access to options like:
  * Pay with your Starbucks card,
  * Place an order, and
  * Find the closest store.

## API Proposal

We are proposing that a new member be added to the [Web App Manifest](https://w3c.github.io/manifest/): `shortcuts`.

```
dictionary WebAppManifest {
  …
  sequence<ShortcutInfo> shortcuts;
}
```

This member would take an array of `ShortcutInfo` objects defined thusly:

```
dictionary ShortcutInfo {
  required USVString name;
  USVString short_name;
  USVString description;
  required USVString url;
  sequence<ImageResource> icons;
  dictionary params;
}
```

### `name`

Provides a human-readable label for the shortcut action when displayed to the user.

### `short_name`

Optional. Provides an abbreviated, human-readable label for the shortcut action. It is intended to be used where there is insufficient space to display the `name`. In its absense, systems looking for this key should fall back to `name`.

### `description`

Optional. Provides the shortcut action’s purpose.

### `url`

The URL that loads when a user activates the shortcut. This URL must exist within [the navigation scope (`scope`) defined in the manifest](https://w3c.github.io/manifest/#scope-member). If the `url` is a relative URL, the base URL will be the URL of the manifest.

### `icons`

Optional. The path to one or more [ImageResource](https://w3c.github.io/manifest/#dom-imageresource)s. If the ImageResource’s `src` is a relative URL, the base URL will be the URL of the manifest.

### `params`

Optional. Parameters to be passed into the target `url` as part of a query string.

### Example

To replicate [the shortcut menu from PlayerFM](#playerfm), an author could do the following:

```json
{
  "name": "PlayerFM",
  "start_url": "https://app.playerfm.com",
  …
  "shortcuts": [
    {
      "name": "Play Later",
      "description": "View the list of podcasts you saved for later",
      "url": "/play-later",
      "icons": [
        {
          "src": "/icons/play-later.svg",
          "type": "image/svg+xml",
          "purpose": "any"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Subscriptions",
      "description": "View the list of podcasts you listen to",
      "url": "/subscriptions",
      "icons": [
        {
          "src": "/icons/subscriptions.svg",
          "type": "image/svg+xml",
          "purpose": "any"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Search",
      "description": "Search for new podcasts to listen to",
      "url": "/search",
      "icons": [
        {
          "src": "/icons/search.svg",
          "type": "image/svg+xml",
          "purpose": "any"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Discover",
      "description": "Browse for new podcasts to listen to",
      "url": "/discover",
      "icons": [
        {
          "src": "/icons/discover.svg",
          "type": "image/svg+xml",
          "purpose": "any"
        }
      ]
    }  
  ]
}
```

### Responding to shortcut activation

There is no need to add any special handler for the shortcut aside from having a URL (which is part of the general site architecture) to respond to the action. A user agent should create a [new](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#creating-a-new-browsing-context) [top-level browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#top-level-browsing-context) to respond to the shortcut activation.


The proposed [`ServiceWorker` Launch Event](https://github.com/WICG/sw-launch), while not tied to Shortcuts in any way, could also be useful for responding to shortcut actions:

```javascript
self.addEventListener('launch', event => {
  // Only "/search" is handled specially. All other URLs navigate as normal.
  if (event.url !== new URL('search', self.registration.scope).href) {
    return;
  }

  event.handleLaunch((async () => {
    // Get an existing client.
    const client = (await clients.matchAll())[0];

    if (client) {
      client.focus();
      client.postMessage('search');
    } else {
      clients.openWindow(event.url);
    }
  })());
});
```

## Existing Implementations

This section describes possible treatment on each major OS. User agents are free to implement however they like, but this should give an idea of what the API will look like in practice. In all cases, the menu items consist of text, a destination, and an icon.

### Android

In Android, shortcut activation is triggered via a long press.  Android allows the static shortcut list to be supplemented at runtime via Dynamic Shortcuts and allows users to rearrange and "pin" shortcut items. ([Documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/shortcuts/creating-shortcuts))

### iOS

In iOS, a hard press (3D Touch) exposes the application shortcuts (iOS 9.0+ on 3D touch-capable devices). iOS also enables a subtitle and has a hard limit of 4 items. ([Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/ApplicationShortcuts/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016545))

### macOS/Windows/Linux GUI/etc.

In most OSes, this context menu is triggered by right clicking (or two finger tapping) on the icon. Windows calls these "Jump Lists" and allows each shortcut item to have a description ([Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.startscreen.jumplist)). In macOS these shortcuts are referred to as the "Dock Menu" ([Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/menus/dock-menus/)).

### Electron

Electron enables shortcuts for macOS and Windows app icons as well. ([Documentation](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/recent-documents))

## Open Questions

1. Should the `icons` member in the Shortcut object be optional?
2. Given that [color schemes are becoming a thing in CSS](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3299), it seems like the icon options should somehow support an indication of whether the icon itself is intended for use in a dark or light theme. <del>Assuming there is interest in that, would it make sense to piggyback on the existing [`purpose` member of an ImageResource](https://w3c.github.io/manifest/#dom-imageresource-purpose) or should there be a new member (e.g., `color_scheme`) added to it?</del> <ins>We’ve drafted an [addition to the ImageResource dictionary for this purpose](../ImageResource-color_scheme/explainer.md).</ins>
3. For more advanced use cases like minimal media player controls (e.g., Spotify, Netflix, etc.), should we provide options for custom shortcut layouts or control groups and JavaScript interaction with the Shortcuts menu? Should that be part of this spec or defined separately?
4. Should we include a hard limit on Shortcuts? If no, should we allow for collections?
5. Does the recommendation for per-language manifest files still stand? Should we look to enable multi-lingual support within a manifest as more text keys get added?

## Considerations for v2

* Enable authors to access and/or mutate Shortcuts via JavaScript (`navigator.shortcuts`?).
* Enable authors to directly trigger JavaScript events from Shortcuts.
* Enable a `ServiceWorker` to listen for and respond to Shortcut events (`shortcutclick`?).
* Allow shortcuts to be aggregated into multiple sections.
* Allow shortcuts to be designated for different contexts (e.g., all apps list vs. home screen/start menu vs. task bar).
